# üì± Calculator Application

This project is a calculator application made using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**, and **CSS**. It performs both basic and scientific calculations, and the design is especially focused on **mobile responsiveness**.

## üöÄ Features

- **Basic Calculations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division operations.
- **Scientific Calculations**:
  - **Exponentiation (x ∏)**: Raising a number to a power.
  - **Reciprocal (1/x)**: Finding the reciprocal of a number.
  - **Factorial (x!)**: Calculating the factorial of a number.
  - **Absolute Value (|x|)**: Finding the absolute value of a number.
  - **Constants**: Pi (œÄ) and Euler's number (e).
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Optimized for easy use even on small screens using **Bootstrap**.
- **Keyboard Support**: You can perform calculations using the keyboard by quickly entering numbers and operators.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in this project:

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the application.
- **CSS3**: Defines the styles of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the calculation operations and functions (Vanilla JavaScript, meaning no external libraries were used).
- **Bootstrap**: A framework for responsive (mobile-friendly) design, making the UI fast and adaptable.
